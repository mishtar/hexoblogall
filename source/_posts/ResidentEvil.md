*Resident Evil 7: Biohazard* is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom, released in January 2017 for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Following the more action-oriented Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6, Resident Evil 7 returns to the franchise's survival horror roots, emphasizing exploration. The player controls Ethan Winters as he searches for his wife in a derelict plantation occupied by the cannibal Baker family, solving puzzles and fighting enemies. It is the first main Resident Evil game to use a first-person perspective.

#### Back to the roots

>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is set in mid-2017 somewhere in the southern United States, where there have been reports of "ghosts" sighted around the bayou of the town, Dulvey. The game proper takes place after the events of Beginning Hour, which ended with the murder of a three-man TV crew by the infected Baker family members Jack and Mia. It features a new protagonist named Ethan Winters, a civilian who offers fewer combat skills than most previous Resident Evil protagonists. Ethan is searching for his missing wife, Mia, which leads him to a derelict plantation mansion, home of the Baker family.
