**Bloodborne** follows the player character, the Hunter, through the decrepit Gothic, Victorian era inspired city of Yharnam, whose inhabitants have been afflicted with an abnormal blood-borne disease. Upon awakening there on the night of the Hunt, the player is forcibly inducted into the ranks of the Hunters and cryptically told to "seek Paleblood". They begin to unravel the city's intriguing mysteries while slaying its many terrifying beasts, eventually attempting to destroy the source of the plague and escape the nightmare.

#### Prepare to die
> The Souls series is known for medieval fantasy settings with castles and dungeons a common sight. However, Bloodborne is based in the city of Yharnam which is described as "ancient" and "forgotten." The city is characterized by a Victorian era feel. Sony has promised a rich, detailed world that highlights the power of the PS4.

* The plot revolves around the city being known for an old medical remedy which the player character will attempt to seek out. Making this task difficult is the endemic elements that have created "nightmarish creatures" and "malformed beasts."

* The combat style is said to be quicker and more offensive based. Preliminary information suggests that shield may not make an appearance, with both hands being used for weapons. Early reports indicate that a gun and scythe like weapon will be the go to gear for this game.
