#### Love letter to Terror and writing
The game tells the story of Alan Wake, a famous writer who has recently been suffering from writers block. He heads to the small town of Bright Falls with his wife, Alice, to hopefully help ease the condition. It's not long before his wife goes missing and he wakes up in front of a crashed car a week later, where he also finds a manuscript he doesn't even remember writing and shadowy men trying to kill him.

Alan Wake uses a unique mechanic where players have to use light to burn away the darkness on creatures called "The Taken". They cannot be harmed until the darkness has been burned away, which can be done with the use of flashlights, flares and in some cases kill them fully with flashbangs. Once the darkness has been burned away, players have to shoot at the enemies to kill them. The game uses "episodes" to keep the player gripped as well as adding cliffhangers to keep the player intrigued.
