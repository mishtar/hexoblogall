> Lone Survivor is a sidescrolling survival horror adventure game developed by Jasper Byrne. The game follows a masked protagonist who must escape from a city ravaged by disease, by any means. Starving and exhausted, he has begun to question how much of what he sees is even real. Sneak through without firing a single shot, or kill everything in your path. Eat and sleep well, or resort to drugs to keep going.

#### Sickness is here

A *nameless* man in a surgical mask (referred to in the game as *'You'*) has been living in an apartment for an unspecified amount of time, after a disease has turned most of the world's inhabitants into mindless, zombie-like monsters. The man has periodic dreams featuring a bizarre cast of characters, including a Man Who Wears a Box and a young girl in a blue dress.

In the waking world, the man is out of supplies and is forced to explore for food, weapons, and other survivors. Following leads picked up from his radio, annotated maps, and discarded diary entries, the man explores his apartment complex with the goal to discover what the true state of the world is in.
